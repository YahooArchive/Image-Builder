# C0111: Don't require docstrings on every method
# R0912: Too many branches (huh)
# R0914: Too many local variables is odd.
# W0142: *args and **kwargs are fine.
# W0511: TODOs in code comments are fine.
# W0613: Unused argument '??' should be ok (they are useful sometimes to know intention of variable)
# W0622: Redefining id is fine.
